# PROJECT-Blackjack 21

Welcome to our Blackjack Game!

The aim of the game blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand by having a total higher than the dealer's or 
by not getting more than 21 if the dealer has 21.

  
To start the game, you have to run the "main" method of our program, or you can also press the green triangle button on 
the top right corner of your IntelliJ program.

We Wish you good luck ;)
